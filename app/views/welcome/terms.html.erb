<br /><br /><strong>PAYMENTS AND PAID SERVICES</strong><br />
<p>
Fees: If you purchase any services that we offer for a fee, including without limitation any premium User services, either on a one-time or subscription basis (collectively, "Paid Services"), you agree to pay all fees and charges specified by the specific service you acquired any part thereof, whether paid for by facebook credits or another method. All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes (e.g., sales, use, or value-added tax), unless otherwise stated, and you are solely responsible for the payment of any such taxes that may be imposed on your use of the Services. Credit Card Authorization: You may be asked to provide YoungVarsity with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept in order to activate and/or pay for any fees related to Paid Services. You agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide may be shared by YoungVarsity with companies, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to YoungVarsity and servicing your account. YoungVarsity may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to a purchase to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.
<br />
Payment Method: YoungVarsity may charge the subscription fee, if and when applicable, and any other additional fees you authorize to the charge or credit card account provided by you. By authorizing YoungVarsity to charge a credit card for the fees associated with your subscription, you are authorizing YoungVarsity to automatically continue charging that card (or any replacement card if the original card is renewed, lost, stolen, or changed for any reason by the card issuer, and the issuer informs YoungVarsity of the new replacement card account) for all fees or charges associated with your subscription including any renewal fees as described below. You authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts described herein and authorize YoungVarsity, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for YoungVarsity, to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit card account until such amounts are paid in full. You agree to provide YoungVarsity updated information on your credit card upon YoungVarsity's request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer valid. If payment is not received by YoungVarsity from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by YoungVarsity.
<br />
Free Trial Period: YoungVarsity may offer you a one-time free trial period during which you can try out the Paid Services for free ("Free Trial Period"). If you are participating in a Free Trial Period, you must cancel the Paid Services by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring any charges. If you do not cancel the Paid Services before the Free Trial Period expires, your account will automatically be converted into a paid subscription at the end of the Free Trial Period, then you authorize us to charge your credit card the applicable fees as indicated at the time you signed up for the Paid Services. During the Free Trial Period, you agree that YoungVarsity will have the right (subject to applicable local law) to send you communications, notices and news about the Paid Services to your email address you may have provided. Local law may allow you to revoke your consent to receiving these communications at any time during the Free Trial Period. YoungVarsity reserves the right to modify, cancel and/or limit this Free Trial Period offer at any time.
Cancellation of Paid Services: You may cancel any Paid Services that are Facebook applications ("Paid Apps") at any time by deleting the application from within your Facebook settings. If you cancel your account in this manner, all Content you have submitted to us may be deleted and shall not be recovered by YoungVarsity. If you delete any Paid Apps such services shall be cancelled and, after you pay for any accrued by unpaid services, you will not receive any future billings. For other Paid Services, you may cancel your account by contacting customer care at team@YoungVarsity.com and you will be provided with instructions. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods or for unused services.
<br />
Automatic Renewal of Subscription: When you sign up online for the Paid Services, your monthly or annual subscription will be set to automatically renew upon its expiration, depending on the option you select. This means that unless you cancel your account or change its renewal settings prior to its expiration, your account will automatically renew for another month or year, as applicable. At the time of renewal, we will charge your credit card the then-current fees to renew the Paid Services. We may notify you by email to your email address that your account is about to renew and remind you that your credit card will be billed the indicated Paid Services fees on the renewal date.
Changes in Price: YoungVarsity may at any time, upon notice required by applicable law, change the price of the Paid Services or any part thereof, or institute new charges or fees. Price changes and institution of new charges implemented during your subscription term will apply to subsequent subscription terms and to all new subscribers after the effective date of the change. If you do not agree to any such price changes, then you must cancel your account and stop using the Paid Services. Your continued use of the Paid Services after the effective date of any such change shall constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
